🏡 Home Automation Using NodeMCU
📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a smart home automation system using NodeMCU (ESP8266) and IoT to remotely control electrical appliances via a web interface. It enables users to turn devices ON/OFF using a smartphone, tablet, or computer from anywhere with an internet connection.

🚀 Features
✅ Remote Control: Control home appliances via a web-based interface.
✅ WiFi Connectivity: Uses NodeMCU (ESP8266) for wireless control.
✅ Real-time Status Update: Displays the current status (ON/OFF) of connected devices.
✅ Energy Efficiency: Helps in reducing power consumption by remotely managing appliances.
✅ Scalability: Easily expandable to control multiple appliances.

🛠️ Technologies Used
NodeMCU (ESP8266): Microcontroller for WiFi-based automation.
Arduino IDE: For coding and uploading firmware to NodeMCU.
MQTT Protocol (Optional): For secure communication between devices.
Relay Module: To switch appliances ON/OFF.

🔮 Future Enhancements
🏠 Mobile App for better user experience.
🔐 Voice Control integration with Alexa/Google Assistant.
📊 Energy Monitoring to track power usage.
🌍 Cloud Integration for global access via MQTT.
